The chicken came first. Why? Because every organism eveolved from a very basic being.
As evolution goes on, complexity of the organism structure increases but due to variations in genes,
different organisms are produced. Ultimately, a single celled organism transforms to a
more complex animal. One of which is. THE CHICKEN!!!
