The Theory of Evolution
If the question refers to chicken eggs specifically, the answer is still the egg, but the explanation 
is more complicated. The process by which the chicken arose through the interbreeding and 
domestication of multiple species of wild jungle fowl is poorly understood, and the point at which 
this evolving organism became a chicken is a somewhat arbitrary distinction. Whatever criteria one 
chooses, an animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a proto-chicken) laid a fertilized 
egg that had DNA identical to the modern chicken (due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the 
father's sperm, or the fertilised zygote). Put more simply by Neil deGrasse Tyson: "Which 
came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg—laid by a bird that was not a chicken."
